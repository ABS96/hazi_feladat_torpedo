# Embedded and ambient systems homework

A simple version of the well-known game Torpedo implemented on the EFM32GG board.

It can be played using the keyboard via a serial port.
See the [main loop](https://github.com/ABS96/hazi_feladat_torpedo/blob/master/src/game_logic.c#L113) for the controls.

The included LCD controller library was written by Gabor Naszaly.
